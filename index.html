            <h2>WORM JUICE FERTILISER IS TEEMING WITH MILLIONS OF BENEFICIAL BACTERIA AND FUNGI MICROBES</h2>
            <p style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Worm Juice is often referred to as Rocket Fuel</p>
            <p>
                There are many large companies who have been producing and selling these worm products for many years.
                There is a growing number of new companies becoming involved. We have listed our favorites at the bottom
                of this page. We are small in comparison to some, but we are proud of our commitment to quality, value for money
                and sustainability.

                    <strong>Andrew</strong>, a dairy farmer in East Gippsland completely changed from synthetic fertilizers to worm juice
                    fertilizer and now has some of the most outstanding pasture in the district. He saved $40k annually.

                    <strong>EXAMPLE:</strong> A 500 ha farm top-dressing single super @ 120 kg/ha/yr would save between $21 k
                    and $31 k annually if they changed to Worm Juice Fertiliser.

            <h3>KEY MICROBES</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pseudomonas</strong>: enables the plant to tolerate lower frost temperatures.</li>
                <li><strong>Sorangium</strong>: produces secondary fungicides and bactericides that reduce competition of pathogens in the soil.</li>
                <li><strong>Penicillium</strong>: produces enzymes, antibiotics, and growth regulators.</li>
                <li><strong>Methylobacterium</strong>: stimulates seed germination.</li>
                <li><strong>Streptomyces</strong>: provides antifungals, antivirals, and antibiotics.</li>
                <li><strong>Myxococcus</strong>: an efficient predator on unwanted bacteria.</li>
                <li><strong>Lactobacillus</strong>: helps plants resist heat, radiation, toxic chemicals, and pH extremes.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Red Wigglers compost worms are known to produce these types of microbes – we use mostly this variety
                of compost worm in our worm beds.

            <h3>IMPORTANT STORAGE INFORMATION</h3>
            <p>
                Our worm juice fertiliser is <strong>alive</strong> and must be stored in the shade, kept cool, and properly vented.
                Care must be taken <strong>not</strong> to store it in a container that has held anything other than water.
                Do not use town water for foliar sprays, as chlorine may kill the microbes.
