        <h3>A Few Interesting Microbe Facts</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pseudomonas</strong>: Enables the plant to tolerate lower frost temperatures.</li>
            <li><strong>Sorangium</strong>: Produces secondary fungicides and bactericides that reduce competition of pathogens in the soil.</li>
            <li><strong>Penicillium</strong>: Fungi that produce enzymes, antibiotics, and growth regulators.</li>
            <li><strong>Methylobacterium</strong>: Stimulates seed germination.</li>
            <li><strong>Streptomyces</strong>: Provides antifungals, antivirals, and antibiotics.</li>
            <li><strong>Myxococcus</strong>: Efficient predator on unwanted bacteria.</li>
            <li><strong>Lactobacillus</strong>: Helps plants resist heat, radiation, toxic chemicals, and pH extremes.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Red Wigglers (compost worms) are known to produce these types of microbes – we use mostly this variety of compost worm.</p>
